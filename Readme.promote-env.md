# Notes on Promoting environments

## Preparation
### Fusion 5 




### Fusion 4
- Same as Fusion 5 for now
- If there are 'real' occurences, send tips, fixes, feedback (https://github.com/seanoc5/upval/)


### Process
Currently there is a groovy script `migrateFusionApp.groovy` that is a **recipe** for migrating an app. This can be improved, and is currently something like 85% complete.
